/*
Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Note:

    Given target value is a floating point.
    You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.

// My thought: in order traversal: if equal stop, if difference is getting larger, then start.
